# slide-switch

slide-switch translates slide switch position changes into normal button
presses and releases for OpenWrt / LEDE devices.

## Usage

After installing slide-switch, follow the instructions at the [OpenWrt
wiki][button howto] to add scripts for each switch position. Both procd
scripts (in `/etc/rc.button`) and hotplug scripts (in
`/etc/hotplug.d/button`) are supported.

Each switch position has a corresponding button name in the form
`<switch name>-<switch position>`. For example, the TP-Link TL-MR3020
has a switch named *mode* with positions "3g", "wisp" and "ap"; button
names for the positions would be `mode-3g`, `mode-wisp` and `mode-ap`.
See [Supported Devices](#supported-devices) for a list of switch names
and positions.

slide-switch will trigger both button presses and releases. For example,
if the *mode* switch is moved from "3g" to "wisp", a release action will
be triggered for "3g" (`BUTTON=mode-3g ACTION=released`), and a press
action will be triggered for "wisp" (`BUTTON=mode-wisp ACTION=pressed`).
Note that the timeout action is not supported at this time.

On boot, slide-switch will also trigger a button press for the active
position of each switch. To disable or re-enable this behaviour, run
`slide-switch boot disable` or `slide-switch boot enable`, respectively.

## Supported Platforms

slide-switch has been tested with OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05 and should
work with current OpenWrt / LEDE development snapshots.

Data for these devices was initially collected from the OpenWrt wiki and
from OpenWrt / LEDE source code. Devices where the switch data has been
verified correct is noted in the Verified column.
